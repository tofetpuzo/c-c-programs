Write a function called exclaim(). This function takes an std::string as argument and returns an std::string.

The function will return the argument string, but with all the punctuation characters replaced by an exclamation mark.

For example, if the argument string is

"To be, or not to be, that is the question:"

The returned string will be

"To be! or not to be! that is the question!"

Use a suitable character function to implement this function.
