sses and Strings Coding Exercise
This exercise is a gentle introduction :)

A simple C++ class represents a URL, such as "http://www.example.com/index.html".

The class has two members of type std::string. One will store the protocol (the "http" part) and the other will store the resource (the "www.example.com/index.html" part which comes after the separator).

Write a constructor for the class which takes the protocol and resource as arguments.

Write a member function which displays the complete URL, including the separator (e.g. "http://www.example.com/index.html")

Write a free function called test(). This function will create an object of the class, then call its member function to display the URL.

All your code should be in the "exercise" namespace.

Coding exercises are new on Udemy and this is the first time I have tried to create one. I apologize for any "rough edges" you may experience :)
